    </span>The hand of Jehovah proved to be upon me, so that he brought me forth in the spirit of Jehovah and set me down in the midst of the valley plain, and it was full of bones. <a id="chapter37_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>And he had me pass along by them all round about, and, look! there were very many on the surface of the valley plain and, look! they were very dry. <a id="chapter37_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>And he began to say to me: “Son of man, can these bones come to life?” To that I said: “Sovereign Lord Jehovah, you yourself well know.” <a id="chapter37_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>And he went on to say to me: “Prophesy over these bones, and you must say to them, ‘O <span class="smcap">YOU </span>dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah:</p>

    </b>And I prophesied just as I had been commanded. And a sound began to occur as soon as I prophesied, and here there was a rattling, and bones began to approach, bone to its bone. <a id="chapter37_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>And I saw, and, look! upon them sinews themselves and flesh itself came up and skin began to be overlaid upon them above.
