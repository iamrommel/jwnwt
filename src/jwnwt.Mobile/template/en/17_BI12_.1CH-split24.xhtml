    </span>Now the sons of Aaron had their divisions. The sons of Aaron were Na′dab and A·bi′hu, El·e·a′zar and Ith′a·mar. <a id="chapter24_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>However, Na′dab and A·bi′hu died before their father, and they did not happen to have any sons, but El·e·a′zar and Ith′a·mar continued to act as priests. <a id="chapter24_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>And David, and Za′dok from the sons of El·e·a′zar, and A·him′e·lech from the sons of Ith′a·mar proceeded to make divisions of them for their office in their service. <a id="chapter24_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>But the sons of El·e·a′zar were found to be more numerous in headmen than the sons of Ith′a·mar. So they distributed them to the sons of El·e·a′zar, as heads for their paternal houses, sixteen, and to the sons of Ith′a·mar, as heads for their paternal houses, eight.</p>

    </b>Further, they distributed them by lots, these along with those, for there had to be chiefs of the holy place and chiefs of the true God from the sons of El·e·a′zar and from the sons of Ith′a·mar. <a id="chapter24_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>Then She·mai′ah the son of Ne·than′el the secretary of the Levites wrote them down before the king and the princes and Za′dok the priest and A·him′e·lech the son of A·bi′a·thar and the heads of the fathers of the priests and of the Levites, one paternal house being picked out for El·e·a′zar and one being picked out for Ith′a·mar.</p>
