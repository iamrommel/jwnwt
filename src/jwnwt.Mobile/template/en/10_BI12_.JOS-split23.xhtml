    </span>And it came about many days after Jehovah had given Israel rest from all their enemies all around, when Joshua was old and advanced in days, <a id="chapter23_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>that Joshua proceeded to call all Israel, its older men and its heads and its judges and its officers, and to say to them: “As for me, I have grown old, I have advanced in days. <a id="chapter23_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>And as for <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, <span class="smcap">YOU </span>have seen all that Jehovah <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>God did to all these nations on <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>account, because Jehovah <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>God was the one who was fighting for <span class="smcap">YOU</span>. <a id="chapter23_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>See, I assigned to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>by lot these nations that remain as an inheritance for <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>tribes, and all the nations that I cut off, from the Jordan to the Great Sea at the setting of the sun. <a id="chapter23_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>And Jehovah <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>God was the one who kept pushing them away from before <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, and he dispossessed them on <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>account, and <span class="smcap">YOU </span>took possession of their land, just as Jehovah <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>God had promised <span class="smcap">YOU</span>.</p>
