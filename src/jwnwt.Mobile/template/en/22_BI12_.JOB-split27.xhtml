    </span>And Job proceeded again to lift up his proverbial utterance and went on to say:</p>

    <a id="chapter27_verse2"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>2 </sup>
    </b>â€œAs God lives, who has taken away my judgment,</p>
  <p class="sz">And as the Almighty lives, who has made my soul bitter,</p>

    <a id="chapter27_verse3"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>3 </sup>
    </b>While my breath is yet whole within me,</p>
  <p class="sz">And the spirit of God is in my nostrils,</p>
  <p class="sl">
    <a id="chapter27_verse4"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>4 </sup>
    </b>My lips will speak no unrighteousness</p>
  <p class="sz">And my own tongue will mutter no deceit!</p>
  <p class="sl">
    <a id="chapter27_verse5"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>5 </sup>
    </b>It is unthinkable on my part that I should declare <span class="smcap">YOU </span>men righteous!</p>
  <p class="sz">Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself!</p>
  <p class="sl">
    <a id="chapter27_verse6"></a>

      <sup>6 </sup>
    </b>On my justness I have laid hold, and I shall not let it go;</p>
