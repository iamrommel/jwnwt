    </span>“Then the kingdom of the heavens will become like ten virgins that took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. <a id="chapter25_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>Five of them were foolish, and five were discreet. <a id="chapter25_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>For the foolish took their lamps but took no oil with them, <a id="chapter25_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>whereas the discreet took oil in their receptacles with their lamps. <a id="chapter25_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>While the bridegroom was delaying, they all nodded and went to sleep. <a id="chapter25_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>Right in the middle of the night there arose a cry, ‘Here is the bridegroom! Be on <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>way out to meet him.’ <a id="chapter25_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>Then all those virgins rose and put their lamps in order. <a id="chapter25_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>The foolish said to the discreet, ‘Give us some of <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>oil, because our lamps are about to go out.’ <a id="chapter25_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>The discreet answered with the words, ‘Perhaps there may not be quite enough for us and <span class="smcap">YOU</span>. Be on <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>way, instead, to those who sell it and buy for yourselves.’ <a id="chapter25_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>While they were going off to buy, the bridegroom arrived, and the virgins that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut. <a id="chapter25_verse11"></a><b><sup>11 </sup></b>Afterwards the rest of the virgins also came, saying, ‘Sir, sir, open to us!’ <a id="chapter25_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>In answer he said, ‘I tell <span class="smcap">YOU </span>the truth, I do not know <span class="smcap">YOU</span>.’</p>

You were faithful over a few things. I will <a id="page1250"></a>appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’ <a id="chapter25_verse22"></a><b><sup>22 </sup></b>Next the one that had received the two talents came forward and said, ‘Master, you committed to me two talents; see, I gained two talents more.’ <a id="chapter25_verse23"></a><b><sup>23 </sup></b>His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave!

Here you have what is yours.’ <a id="chapter25_verse26"></a><b><sup>26 </sup></b>In reply his master said to him, ‘Wicked and sluggish slave, you knew, did you, that I reaped where I did not sow and gathered where I did not winnow? <a id="chapter25_verse27"></a><b><sup>27 </sup></b>Well, then, you ought to have deposited my silver monies with the bankers, and on my arrival I would be receiving what is mine with interest.</p>
