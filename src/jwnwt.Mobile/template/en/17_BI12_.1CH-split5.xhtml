    </b>As for the sons of Reu′ben and the Gad′ites and the half tribe of Ma·nas′seh; of those who were valiant fellows, men carrying shield and sword and bending the bow and trained in war, there were forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty going out to the army. <a id="chapter5_verse19"></a><b><sup>19 </sup></b>And they began to make war upon the Hag′rites, and Je′tur and Na′phish and No′dab. <a id="chapter5_verse20"></a><b><sup>20 </sup></b>And they came to be helped against them, so that the Hag′rites and all those who were with them were given into their hand, for it was to God that they called for aid in the war, and he let himself be entreated in their favor because they trusted in him. <a id="chapter5_verse21"></a><b><sup>21 </sup></b>And they got to take captive their livestock, their camels fifty thousand, and sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and asses two thousand, and human souls a hundred thousand. <a id="chapter5_verse22"></a><b><sup>22 </sup></b>For there were many that had fallen slain, because it was on the part of the true God that the fighting was. And they continued to dwell in their place down to the time of the exile.</p>

    </b>As for the sons of the half tribe of Ma·nas′seh, they dwelt in the land from Ba′shan to Ba′al-her′mon and Se′nir and Mount Her′mon. They themselves became numerous. <a id="chapter5_verse24"></a><b><sup>24 </sup></b>And these were the heads of the house of their forefathers: E′pher and Ish′i and E′li·el and Az′ri·el and Jeremiah and Hod·a·vi′ah and Jah′di·el, men that were valiant, mighty fellows, men of fame, heads of the house of their forefathers. <a id="chapter5_verse25"></a><b><sup>25 </sup></b>And they began to act unfaithfully toward the God of their forefathers and went having immoral intercourse with the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had annihilated from before them. <a id="chapter5_verse26"></a><b><sup>26 </sup></b>Consequently the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul the king of As·syr′i·a even the spirit of Til′gath-pil·ne′ser the king of As·syr′i·a, so that he took into exile those of the Reu′ben·ites and of the Gad′ites and of the half tribe of Ma·nas′seh and brought them to Ha′lah and Ha′bor and Ha′ra and the river Go′zan to continue until this day.</p>
