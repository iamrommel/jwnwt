    </span>And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to me, saying: <a id="chapter25_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>“Son of man, set your face toward the sons of Am′mon and prophesy against them. <a id="chapter25_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>And you must say concerning the sons of Am′mon, ‘Hear the word of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “For the reason that you have said Aha! against my sanctuary, because it has been profaned, and against the soil of Israel, because it has been laid desolate, and against the house of Judah, because they have gone into exile, <a id="chapter25_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>therefore here I am giving you to the Orientals as something to possess, and they will set up their walled camps in you and will certainly put in you their tabernacles. They themselves will eat your fruitage, and they themselves will drink your milk. <a id="chapter25_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>And I will make Rab′bah a pasture ground of camels and the sons of Am′mon a resting-place of a flock; and <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people will have to know that I am Jehovah.”’”</p>
