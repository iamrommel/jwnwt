    </span>Paul and Sil·va′nus and Timothy to the congregation of the Thes·sa·lo′ni·ans in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
  <p class="sb">May <span class="smcap">YOU </span>have undeserved kindness and peace.</p>

      <sup>2 </sup>
    </b>We always thank God when we make mention concerning all of <span class="smcap">YOU </span>in our prayers, <a id="chapter1_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>for we bear incessantly in mind <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>faithful work and <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>loving labor and <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>endurance due to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>hope in our Lord Jesus Christ before our God and Father. <a id="chapter1_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>For we know, brothers loved by God, his choosing of <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, <a id="chapter1_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>because the good news we preach did not turn up among <span class="smcap">YOU </span>with speech alone but also with power and with holy spirit and strong conviction, just as <span class="smcap">YOU </span>know what sort of men we became to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>for <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>sakes; <a id="chapter1_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>and <span class="smcap">YOU </span>became imitators of us and of the Lord, seeing that <span class="smcap">YOU </span>accepted the word under much tribulation with joy of holy spirit, <a id="chapter1_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>so that <span class="smcap">YOU </span>came to be an example to all the believers in Mac·e·do′ni·a and in A·cha′ia.</p>

    </b>The fact is, not only has the word of Jehovah sounded forth from <span class="smcap">YOU </span>in Mac·e·do′ni·a and <a id="page1474"></a>A·cha′ia, but in every place <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>faith toward God has spread abroad, so that we do not need to say anything. <a id="chapter1_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>For they themselves keep reporting about the way we first entered in among <span class="smcap">YOU </span>and how <span class="smcap">YOU </span>turned to God from <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>idols to slave for a living and true God, <a id="chapter1_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>and to wait for his Son from the heavens, whom he raised up from the dead, namely, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming.</p>
