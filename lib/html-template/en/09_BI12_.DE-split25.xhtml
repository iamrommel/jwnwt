    </span>“In case a dispute arises between men, and they have presented themselves for the judgment, they must also <a id="page270"></a>judge them and pronounce the righteous one righteous and pronounce the wicked one wicked. <a id="chapter25_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>And it must occur that if the wicked one deserves to be beaten, the judge must also have him laid prostrate and given strokes before him by number to correspond with his wicked deed. <a id="chapter25_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>With forty strokes he may beat him. He should add none, for fear he should continue to beat him with many strokes in addition to these and your brother is actually disgraced in your eyes.</p>

    </b>“In case brothers dwell together and one of them has died without his having a son, the wife of the dead one should not become a strange man’s outside. Her brother-in-law should go to her, and he must take her as his wife and perform brother-in-law marriage with her. <a id="chapter25_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>And it must occur that the firstborn whom she will bear should succeed to the name of his dead brother, that his name may not be wiped out of Israel.</p>

He has not consented to perform brother-in-law marriage with me.’ <a id="chapter25_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>And the older men of his city must call him and speak to him, and he must stand and say, ‘I have found no delight in taking her.’ <a id="chapter25_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>At that his brother’s widow must approach him before the eyes of the older men and draw his sandal off his foot and spit in his face and answer and say, ‘That is the way it should be done to the man who will not build up his brother’s household.’ <a id="chapter25_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>And his name must be called in Israel ‘The house of the one who had his sandal drawn off.’</p>
