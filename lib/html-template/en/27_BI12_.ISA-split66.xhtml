    </span>This is what Jehovah has said: “The heavens are my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Where, then, is the house that <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people can build for me, and where, then, is the place as a resting-place for me?”</p>

    </b>“The one slaughtering the bull is as one striking down a man. The one sacrificing the sheep is as one breaking the neck of a dog. The one offering up a gift—the blood of a pig! The one presenting a memorial of frankincense is as one saying a blessing with uncanny words. They are also the ones that have chosen their own ways, and in their disgusting things their very soul has taken a delight. <a id="chapter66_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>I myself, in turn, shall choose ways of ill-treating them; <a id="page962"></a>and the things frightful to them I shall bring upon them; for the reason that I called, but there was no one answering; I spoke, but there were none that listened; and they kept on doing what was bad in my eyes, and the thing in which I took no delight they chose.”</p>

    </b>Before she began to come into labor pains she gave birth. Before birth pangs could come to her, she even gave deliverance to a male child. <a id="chapter66_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>Who has heard of a thing like this? Who has seen things like these? Will a land be brought forth with labor pains in one day? Or will a nation be born at one time? For Zion has come into labor pains as well as given birth to her sons.</p>
