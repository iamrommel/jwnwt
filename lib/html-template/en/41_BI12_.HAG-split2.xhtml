    </span>In the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of Jehovah occurred by means of Hag′gai the <a id="page1198"></a>prophet, saying: <a id="chapter2_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>“Say, please, to Ze·rub′ba·bel the son of She·al′ti·el, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Je·hoz′a·dak the high priest, and to the remaining ones of the people, saying, <a id="chapter2_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>‘Who is there among <span class="smcap">YOU </span>that is remaining over who saw this house in its former glory?

  <p class="sb">“‘For I am with <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people,’ is the utterance of Jehovah of armies. <a id="chapter2_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>‘Remember the thing that I concluded with <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people when <span class="smcap">YOU </span>came forth from Egypt, and when my spirit was standing in among <span class="smcap">YOU</span>.

    <b>
      <sup>10 </sup>
    </b>In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Da·ri′us, the word of Jehovah occurred to Hag′gai the prophet, saying: <a id="chapter2_verse11"></a><b><sup>11 </sup></b>“This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘Ask, please, the priests as to the law, saying: <a id="chapter2_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>“If a man carries holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and he actually touches with his skirt bread or stew or wine or oil or any sort of food, will it become holy?”’”</p>
  <p class="sb">And the priests proceeded to answer and say: “No!”</p>
  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter2_verse13"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>13 </sup>
    </b>And Hag′gai went on to say: “If someone unclean by a deceased soul touches any of these things, will it become unclean?”</p>
  <p class="sb">In turn the priests answered and said: “It will become unclean.”</p>
  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter2_verse14"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>14 </sup>
    </b>Accordingly Hag′gai answered and said: “‘That is how this people is, and that is how this nation is before me,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and that is how all the work of their hands is, and whatever they present there. It is unclean.’</p>
  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter2_verse15"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>15 </sup>
    </b>“‘But now, please, set <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>heart on this from this day and forward, before there was the placing of a stone upon a stone in the temple of Jehovah, <a id="chapter2_verse16"></a><b><sup>16 </sup></b>from when those things happened to be—one came to a heap of twenty measures, and it proved to be ten; one came to the press vat to draw off fifty measures of the wine trough, and it proved to be twenty; <a id="chapter2_verse17"></a><b><sup>17 </sup></b>I struck <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people with scorching and with mildew and with hail, even all the work of <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>hands, and there was no one with <span class="smcap">YOU </span>turning to me,’ is the utterance of Jehovah—</p>
  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter2_verse18"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>18 </sup>
    </b>“‘Set <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>heart, please, on this from this day and forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day that the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was laid; set <a id="page1199"></a><span class="smcap">YOUR </span>heart on this: <a id="chapter2_verse19"></a><b><sup>19 </sup></b>Is there as yet the seed in the grain pit?

  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter2_verse20"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>20 </sup>
    </b>And the word of Jehovah proceeded to occur a second time to Hag′gai on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying: <a id="chapter2_verse21"></a><b><sup>21 </sup></b>“Say to Ze·rub′ba·bel the governor of Judah, ‘I am rocking the heavens and the earth. <a id="chapter2_verse22"></a><b><sup>22 </sup></b>And I shall certainly overthrow the throne of kingdoms and annihilate the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariot and its riders, and the horses and their riders will certainly come down, each one by the sword of his brother.’”</p>

    <a id="chapter2_verse23"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>23 </sup>
    </b>“‘In that day,’ is the utterance of Jehovah of armies, ‘I shall take you, O Ze·rub′ba·bel the son of She·al′ti·el, my servant,’ is the utterance of Jehovah; ‘and I shall certainly set you as a seal ring, because you are the one whom I have chosen,’ is the utterance of Jehovah of armies.”</p>
