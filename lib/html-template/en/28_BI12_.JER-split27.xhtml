    </span>In the beginning of the kingdom of Je·hoi′a·kim the son of Jo·si′ah, the king of Judah, this word occurred to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying: <a id="chapter27_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>“This is what Jehovah has said to me, ‘Make for yourself bands and yoke bars, and you must put them upon your neck. <a id="chapter27_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>And you must send them to the king of E′dom and to the king of Mo′ab and to the king of the sons of Am′mon and to the king of Tyre and to the king of Si′don by the hand of the messengers who are coming to Jerusalem to Zed·e·ki′ah the king of Judah. <a id="chapter27_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>And you must give them a command for their masters, saying:</p>
  <p class="sb">“‘“This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said; this is what <span class="smcap">YOU </span>should say to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>masters, <a id="chapter27_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>‘I myself have made the earth, mankind and the beasts that are upon the surface of the earth by my great power and by my stretched-out arm; and I have given it to whom it has proved right in my eyes. <a id="chapter27_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>And now I myself have given all these lands into the hand of Neb·u·chad·nez′zar the king of Babylon, my servant; and even the wild beasts of the field I have given him to serve him. <a id="chapter27_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>And all the nations must serve even him and his son and his grandson until the time even of his own land comes, and many nations and great kings must exploit him as a servant.’</p>
  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter27_verse8"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>8 </sup>
    </b>“‘“‘And it must occur that the nation and the kingdom that will not serve him, even Neb·u·chad·nez′zar the king of Babylon; and the one that will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, with the sword and with the famine and with the pestilence I shall turn my attention upon that nation,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘until I shall have finished them off by his hand.’</p>

    <b>
      <sup>9 </sup>
    </b>“‘“‘And as for <span class="smcap">YOU </span>men, do not listen to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>prophets and to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>practicers of divination and to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>dreamers and to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>practicers of magic and to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>sorcerers, who are saying to <span class="smcap">YOU</span>: “Y<span class="smcap">OU </span>men will not serve the king of Babylon.” <a id="chapter27_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>For falsehood is what they are prophesying to <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, for the purpose of having <span class="smcap">YOU </span>taken far away from off <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>ground; and I shall have to disperse <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, and <span class="smcap">YOU </span>will have to perish.</p>

    <b>
      <sup>12 </sup>
    </b>Even to Zed·e·ki′ah the king of Judah I spoke according to all these words, saying: “Bring <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people and keep on living. <a id="chapter27_verse13"></a><b><sup>13 </sup></b>Why should you yourself and your people die by the sword, by the famine <a id="page1003"></a>and by the pestilence according to what Jehovah has spoken to the nation that does not serve the king of Babylon? <a id="chapter27_verse14"></a><b><sup>14 </sup></b>And do not listen to the words of the prophets that are saying to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>men, ‘Y<span class="smcap">OU </span>will not serve the king of Babylon,’ because falsehood is what they are prophesying to <span class="smcap">YOU</span>.</p>
