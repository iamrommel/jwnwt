    </b>May <span class="smcap">YOU </span>have undeserved kindness and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

      <sup>3 </sup>
    </b>We are obligated to give God thanks always for <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, brothers, as it is fitting, because <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>faith is growing exceedingly and the love of each and all of <span class="smcap">YOU </span>is increasing one toward the other. <a id="chapter1_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>As a result we ourselves take pride in <span class="smcap">YOU </span>among the congregations of God because of <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>endurance and faith in all <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>persecutions and the tribulations that <span class="smcap">YOU </span>are bearing. <a id="chapter1_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>This is a proof of the righteous judgment of God, leading to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>being counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which <span class="smcap">YOU </span>are indeed suffering.</p>

      <sup>6 </sup>
    </b>This takes into account that it is righteous on God’s part to repay tribulation to those who make tribulation for <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, <a id="chapter1_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>but, to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>who suffer tribulation, relief along with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels <a id="chapter1_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>in a flaming fire, as he brings vengeance upon those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus. <a id="chapter1_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>These very ones will undergo the judicial punishment of everlasting destruction from before the Lord and from the glory of his strength, <a id="chapter1_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>at the time he comes to be glorified in connection with his holy ones and to be regarded in that day with wonder in connection with all those who exercised faith, because the witness we gave met with faith among <span class="smcap">YOU</span>.</p>

      <sup>11 </sup>
    </b>To that very end indeed we always pray for <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, that our God may count <span class="smcap">YOU </span>worthy of his calling and perform completely all he pleases of goodness and the work of faith with power; <a id="chapter1_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>in order that the name of <a id="page1478"></a>our Lord Jesus may be glorified in <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, and <span class="smcap">YOU </span>in union with him, in accord with the undeserved kindness of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
