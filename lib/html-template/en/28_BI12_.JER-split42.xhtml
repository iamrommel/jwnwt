    </span>Then all the chiefs of the military forces and Jo·ha′nan the son of Ka·re′ah and Jez·a·ni′ah the son of Ho·shai′ah and all the people, from the <a id="page1026"></a>smallest one even to the greatest one, approached <a id="chapter42_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>and said to Jeremiah the prophet: “May our request for favor, please, fall before you, and do you pray in our behalf to Jehovah your God, in behalf of all this remnant, for we have been left remaining, a few out of many, just as your eyes are seeing us. <a id="chapter42_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>And may Jehovah your God tell us the way in which we should walk and the thing that we should do.”</p>
  <p class="sb">

    <b>
      <sup>4 </sup>
    </b>At that Jeremiah the prophet said to them: “I have heard. Here I am praying to Jehovah <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>God according to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>words; and it will certainly occur that every word that Jehovah gives in answer to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>I shall tell <span class="smcap">YOU</span>. I shall not hold back from <span class="smcap">YOU </span>a word.”</p>
  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter42_verse5"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>5 </sup>
    </b>And they, for their part, said to Jeremiah: “May Jehovah prove to be a true and faithful witness against us if it is not according to every word with which Jehovah your God sends you to us that we shall exactly do. <a id="chapter42_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>Whether good or bad, it is the voice of Jehovah our God to whom we are sending you that we shall obey, to the intent that it may go well with us because we obey the voice of Jehovah our God.”</p>

      <sup>7 </sup>
    </b>Now it came about at the end of ten days that the word of Jehovah proceeded to occur to Jeremiah. <a id="chapter42_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>So he called for Jo·ha′nan the son of Ka·re′ah and for all the chiefs of the military forces who were with him and for all the people, from the smallest one even to the greatest one; <a id="chapter42_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>and he went on to say to them: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel, to whom <span class="smcap">YOU </span>sent me to cause <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>request for favor to fall before him, has said, <a id="chapter42_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>‘If <span class="smcap">YOU </span>will without fail keep dwelling in this land, I will also build <span class="smcap">YOU </span>up and I shall not tear <span class="smcap">YOU </span>down, and I will plant <span class="smcap">YOU </span>and I shall not uproot <span class="smcap">YOU</span>; for I shall certainly feel regret over the calamity that I have caused to <span class="smcap">YOU</span>. <a id="chapter42_verse11"></a><b><sup>11 </sup></b>Do not be afraid because of the king of Babylon, of whom <span class="smcap">YOU </span>are in fear.’</p>
  <p class="sb">“‘Do not be afraid because of him,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘for I am with <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, in order to save <span class="smcap">YOU </span>and to deliver <span class="smcap">YOU </span>out of his hand. <a id="chapter42_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>And I shall give to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>mercies, and he will certainly have mercy upon <span class="smcap">YOU </span>and return <span class="smcap">YOU </span>to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>own soil.</p>

    <b>

    </b>“‘But if <span class="smcap">YOU </span>are saying: “No; we are not going to dwell in this land!” in order to disobey the voice of Jehovah <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>God, <a id="chapter42_verse14"></a><b><sup>14 </sup></b>saying: “No, but into the land of Egypt we shall enter, where we shall see no war and the sound of the horn we shall not hear and for bread we shall not go hungry; and there is where we shall dwell”; <a id="chapter42_verse15"></a><b><sup>15 </sup></b>even now therefore hear the word of Jehovah, O remnant of Judah. This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said: “If <span class="smcap">YOU </span>yourselves positively set <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>faces to enter into Egypt and <span class="smcap">YOU </span>actually enter in to reside there as aliens, <a id="chapter42_verse16"></a><b><sup>16 </sup></b>it must also occur that the very sword of which <span class="smcap">YOU </span>are afraid will there catch up with <span class="smcap">YOU </span>in the land of Egypt, and the very famine at which <span class="smcap">YOU </span>are in a fright will there closely follow after <span class="smcap">YOU </span>to Egypt; and there is where <span class="smcap">YOU </span>will die. <a id="chapter42_verse17"></a><b><sup>17 </sup></b>And it will come about that all the men that have set their faces to enter into Egypt to reside there as aliens will be the ones to die by the sword, by the famine and by the pestilence; and they will not come to have a survivor or an escapee, because of the calamity that I am bringing in upon them.”’</p>

    <a id="chapter42_verse18"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>18 </sup>
    </b>“For this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Just as my anger and my rage have been poured out upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my rage will be poured out upon <a id="page1027"></a><span class="smcap">YOU </span>because of <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>entering into Egypt, and <span class="smcap">YOU </span>will certainly become a curse and an object of astonishment and a malediction and a reproach, and <span class="smcap">YOU </span>will no more see this place.’</p>
