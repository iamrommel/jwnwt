    </span>“On my bed during the nights I have sought the one whom my soul has loved. I sought him, but I did not find him. <a id="chapter3_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>Let me rise up, please, and go round about in the city; in the streets and in the public squares let me seek the one whom my soul has loved. I sought him, but I did not find him. <a id="chapter3_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>The watchmen who were going around in the city found me, ‘The one whom my soul has loved have <span class="smcap">YOU </span>men seen?’ <a id="chapter3_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>Hardly had I passed on from them until I found the one whom my soul has loved. I grabbed hold of him, and I would not let go of him, until I had brought him into my mother’s house and into the interior room of her that had been pregnant with me. <a id="chapter3_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>I have put <span class="smcap">YOU </span>under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the female gazelles or by the hinds of the field, that <span class="smcap">YOU </span>try not to awaken or arouse love in me until it feels inclined.”</p>
