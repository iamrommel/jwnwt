    </span>In those days Hez·e·ki′ah got sick to the point of dying. Accordingly Isaiah the son of A′moz the prophet came in to him and said to him: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Give commands to your household, for you yourself will indeed die and will not live.’” <a id="chapter38_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>At that Hez·e·ki′ah turned his face to the wall and began to pray to Jehovah <a id="chapter38_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>and to say: “I beseech you, O Jehovah, remember, please, how I have walked before you in truthfulness and with a complete heart, and what was good in your eyes I have done.” And Hez·e·ki′ah began to weep profusely.</p>
  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter38_verse4"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>4 </sup>
    </b>And the word of Jehovah now occurred to Isaiah, saying: <a id="chapter38_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>“Go, and you must say to Hez·e·ki′ah, ‘This is what Jehovah the God of David your forefather has said: “I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Here I am adding onto your days fifteen years; <a id="chapter38_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>and out of the palm of the king of As·syr′i·a I shall deliver you and this city, and I will defend this city. <a id="chapter38_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>And this is the sign for you from Jehovah that Jehovah will perform this word that he has spoken: <a id="chapter38_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>Here I am making the shadow of the steps that had gone down on the steps of the stairs of A′haz by the sun retrace backward ten steps.”’” And the sun gradually went back ten steps on the steps of the stairs that it had gone down.</p>
