    </span>“Do come back, O Israel, to Jehovah your God, for you have stumbled in your error. <a id="chapter14_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>Take with yourselves words and come back to Jehovah. Say to him, all <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people, ‘May you pardon error; and accept what is good, and we will offer in return the young bulls of our lips. <a id="chapter14_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>As·syr′i·a itself will not save us. Upon horses we shall not ride. And no more shall we say: “O our God!” to the work of our hands, because it is by you that a fatherless boy is shown mercy.’</p>

    </b>“I shall heal their unfaithfulness. I shall love them of my own free will, because my anger has turned back from him. <a id="chapter14_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>I shall become like the dew to Israel. He will blossom like the lily, and will strike his roots like Leb′a·non. <a id="chapter14_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>His twigs will go forth, and his dignity will become like that of the olive tree, and his fragrance will be like that of Leb′a·non. <a id="chapter14_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>They will again be dwellers in his shadow. They will grow grain, and will bud like the vine. His memorial will be like the wine of Leb′a·non.</p>
