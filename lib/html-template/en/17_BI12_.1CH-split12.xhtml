    </span>And these are the ones that came to David at Zik′lag while he was still under restrictions because of Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men, the helpers in the warfare, <a id="chapter12_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>armed with the bow, using the right hand and using the left hand with stones or with arrows in the bow. They were of the brothers of Saul, of Benjamin. <a id="chapter12_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>There was the head A·hi·e′zer and Jo′ash the sons of She·ma′ah the Gib′e·ath·ite, and Je′zi·el and Pel′et the sons of Az′ma·veth, and Ber′a·cah and Je′hu the An′a·thoth·ite, <a id="chapter12_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>and Ish·ma′iah the Gib′e·on·ite, a mighty man among the thirty and over the thirty; and Jeremiah and Ja·ha·zi′el and Jo·ha′nan and Jo′za·bad the Ge·de′rath·ite, <a id="chapter12_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>E·lu′zai and Jer′i·moth and Be·a·li′ah and Shem·a·ri′ah and Sheph·a·ti′ah the Har′i·phite, <a id="chapter12_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>El·ka′nah and Is·shi′ah and Az′ar·el and Jo·e′zer and Ja·sho′be·am, the Ko′rah·ites, <a id="chapter12_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>and Jo·e′lah and Zeb·a·di′ah the sons of Je·ro′ham of Ge′dor.</p>

    </b>And there were some of the Gad′ites that separated themselves to David’s side at the place difficult to approach in the wilderness, valiant, mighty men, army men for the war, keeping the large shield and the lance ready, whose faces were the faces of lions, and they were like the gazelles upon the mountains for speed. <a id="chapter12_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>E′zer was the head, O·ba·di′ah the second, E·li′ab the third, <a id="chapter12_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>Mish·man′nah the fourth, Jeremiah the <a id="page554"></a>fifth, <a id="chapter12_verse11"></a><b><sup>11 </sup></b>At′tai the sixth, E′li·el the seventh, <a id="chapter12_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>Jo·ha′nan the eighth, El·za′bad the ninth, <a id="chapter12_verse13"></a><b><sup>13 </sup></b>Jeremiah the tenth, Mach′ban·nai the eleventh. <a id="chapter12_verse14"></a><b><sup>14 </sup></b>These were of the sons of Gad, heads of the army. The least one was equal to a hundred, and the greatest to a thousand. <a id="chapter12_verse15"></a><b><sup>15 </sup></b>These are the ones that crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they then chased away all those of the low plains, to the east and to the west.</p>
  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter12_verse16"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>16 </sup>
    </b>And some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah proceeded to come clear to the place difficult to approach, to David. <a id="chapter12_verse17"></a><b><sup>17 </sup></b>Then David went out before them and answered and said to them: “If it is for peace that <span class="smcap">YOU </span>have come to me to help me, my own heart will become at unity with <span class="smcap">YOU</span>. But if it is to betray me to my adversaries when there is no wrong on my palms, let the God of our forefathers see to it and set it in order.” <a id="chapter12_verse18"></a><b><sup>18 </sup></b>And spirit itself enveloped A·ma′sai, the head of the thirty:</p>
  <p class="sp">“Yours we are, O David, and with you we are, O son of Jes′se.</p>
  <p class="sz">Peace, peace be yours, and peace to the one helping you,</p>
  <p class="sz">For your God has helped you.”</p>
  <p class="sb">So David received them and put them among the heads of the troops.</p>

    </b>And there were some of Ma·nas′seh that deserted to David when he came with the Phi·lis′tines against Saul for battle; but he did not help them, for on counsel the axis lords of the Phi·lis′tines sent him away, saying: “At the risk of our own heads he will desert to his lord Saul.” <a id="chapter12_verse20"></a><b><sup>20 </sup></b>When he came to Zik′lag there deserted to him from Ma·nas′seh Ad′nah and Jo′za·bad and Je·di′a·el and Mi′cha·el and Jo′za·bad and E·li′hu and Zil′le·thai, heads of the thousands that belonged to Ma·nas′seh. <a id="chapter12_verse21"></a><b><sup>21 </sup></b>And they, for their part, were of help to David against the marauder band, because all of them were mighty men of valor, and they came to be chiefs in the army; <a id="chapter12_verse22"></a><b><sup>22 </sup></b>for day by day people kept coming to David to help him, until it was a great camp, like the camp of God.</p>
