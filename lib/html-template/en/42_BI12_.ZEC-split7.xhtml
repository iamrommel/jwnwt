    </span>Furthermore, it came about that in the fourth year of Da·ri′us the king the word of Jehovah occurred to Zech·a·ri′ah, on the fourth day of the ninth month, that is, in Chis′lev. <a id="chapter7_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>And Beth′el proceeded to send Shar·e′zer and Re′gem-mel′ech and his men to soften the face of Jehovah, <a id="chapter7_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>saying to the priests who belonged to the house of Jehovah of armies, and to the prophets, even saying: “Shall I weep in the fifth month, practicing an abstinence, the way I have done these O how many years?”</p>

    </b>And the word of Jehovah of armies continued to occur to me, saying: <a id="chapter7_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>“Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, ‘When <span class="smcap">YOU </span>fasted and there was a wailing in the fifth month and in the seventh month, and this for seventy years, did <span class="smcap">YOU </span>really fast to me, even me? <a id="chapter7_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>And when <span class="smcap">YOU </span>would eat and when <span class="smcap">YOU </span>would drink, were not <span class="smcap">YOU </span>the ones doing the eating, and were not <span class="smcap">YOU </span>the ones doing the drinking? <a id="chapter7_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>Should <span class="smcap">YOU </span>not obey the words that Jehovah called out by means of the former prophets, while Jerusalem happened to be inhabited, and at ease, with her cities all around her, and while the Neg′eb and the She·phe′lah were inhabited?’”</p>

    </b>And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to Zech·a·ri′ah, saying: <a id="chapter7_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>“This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘With true justice do <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>judging; and carry on with one another loving-kindness and mercies; <a id="chapter7_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>and defraud no widow or fatherless boy, no alien resident or afflicted one, and scheme out nothing bad against one another in <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>hearts.’ <a id="chapter7_verse11"></a><b><sup>11 </sup></b>But they kept refusing to pay attention, and they kept giving a stubborn shoulder, and their ears they made too unresponsive to hear. <a id="chapter7_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>And their heart they set as an emery stone to keep from obeying the law and the words that Jehovah of armies sent by his spirit, by means of the former prophets; so that there occurred great indignation on the part of Jehovah of armies.”</p>

    </b>“‘And so it occurred that, just as he called and they did not listen, so they would call and I would not listen,’ Jehovah of armies has said. <a id="chapter7_verse14"></a><b><sup>14 </sup></b>‘And I proceeded tempestuously to hurl them throughout all the nations that they had not known; and the land itself has been left desolate behind them, with no one passing through and with no one returning; and they proceeded to make the desirable land an object of astonishment.’”</p>
