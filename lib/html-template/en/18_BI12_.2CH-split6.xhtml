    </b>Then the king turned his face and began to bless all the congregation of Israel, while all the congregation of Israel were standing up. <a id="chapter6_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>And he went on to say: “Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, who spoke with his own mouth with David my father and by his own hands has given fulfillment, saying, <a id="chapter6_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>‘From the day that I brought my people out from the land of Egypt I have not chosen a city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house for my name to prove to be there, and I have not chosen a man to become leader over my people Israel. <a id="chapter6_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>But I shall choose Jerusalem for my name to prove to be there, and I shall choose David to come to be over my people Israel.’ <a id="chapter6_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>And it came to be close to the heart of David my father to build a house to the name of Jehovah the God of Israel. <a id="chapter6_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>But Jehovah said to David my father, ‘For the reason that it proved to be close to your heart to build a house to my name, you did well because it proved to be close to your heart. <a id="chapter6_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>Only you yourself will not build the house, but your son who is coming forth from your loins is the one that will build the house to my name.’ <a id="chapter6_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>And Jehovah proceeded to carry out his word that he had spoken, that I might rise up in the place of David my father and sit upon the throne of Israel, just as Jehovah had spoken, and that I might build the house to the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, <a id="chapter6_verse11"></a><b><sup>11 </sup></b>and that I might place there the Ark where the covenant of Jehovah is that he concluded with the sons of Israel.”</p>

Its length was five cubits, and its width five cubits, and its height three cubits; and he kept standing upon it.) And he proceeded to kneel upon his knees in front of all the congregation of Israel and to spread his palms out to the heavens. <a id="chapter6_verse14"></a><b><sup>14 </sup></b>And he went on to say: “O Jehovah the God of Israel, there is no God like you in the heavens or on the earth, keeping the covenant and the loving-kindness toward your servants who are walking before you with all their heart; <a id="chapter6_verse15"></a><b><sup>15 </sup></b>you who have kept toward your servant David my father what you promised him, so that you made the promise with your mouth, and with your own hand you have made fulfillment as at this day. <a id="chapter6_verse16"></a><b><sup>16 </sup></b>And now, O Jehovah the God of Israel, keep toward your servant David my father what you promised him, saying, ‘There will not be cut off a man of yours from before me to sit upon the throne of Israel, if only your sons will take care of their way by walking in my law, just as you have walked before me.’ <a id="chapter6_verse17"></a><b><sup>17 </sup></b>And now, O Jehovah the God of Israel, let your promise that <a id="page582"></a>you have promised to your servant David prove trustworthy.</p>
