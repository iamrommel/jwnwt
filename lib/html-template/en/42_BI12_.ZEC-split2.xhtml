    </span>And I proceeded to raise my eyes and see; and, look! there was a man, and in his hand a measuring rope. <a id="chapter2_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>So I said: “Where are you going?”</p>
  <p class="sb">In turn he said to me: “To measure Jerusalem, in order to see what her breadth amounts to and what her length amounts to.”</p>
