At this Og the king of Ba′shan came on out, he and all his people, to meet us in battle at Ed′re·i. <a id="chapter3_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>So Jehovah said to me, ‘Do not be afraid of him, for I shall certainly give him and all his people and his land into your hand; and you must do to him just as you did to Si′hon the king of the Am′or·ites, who was dwelling in Hesh′bon.’ <a id="chapter3_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>Accordingly Jehovah our God gave into our hand also Og the king of Ba′shan and all his people, and we kept striking him until he had no survivor remaining. <a id="chapter3_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>And we went capturing all his cities at that particular time. There proved to be no town that we did not take from them, sixty cities, all the region of Ar′gob, the kingdom of Og in Ba′shan. <a id="chapter3_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>All these were cities fortified with a high wall, doors and bar, aside from very many rural towns. <a id="chapter3_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>However, we devoted them to destruction, just as we had done to Si′hon the king of Hesh′bon, in devoting every city <a id="page240"></a>to destruction, men, women and little children. <a id="chapter3_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>And all the domestic animals and the spoil of the cities we took as plunder for ourselves.</p>

Nine cubits is its length, and four cubits its width, by the cubit of a man. <a id="chapter3_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>And we took possession of this land at that particular time; from A·ro′er, which is by the torrent valley of Ar′non, and half of the mountainous region of Gil′e·ad, and its cities I have given to the Reu′ben·ites and the Gad′ites. <a id="chapter3_verse13"></a><b><sup>13 </sup></b>And the rest of Gil′e·ad and all Ba′shan of the kingdom of Og I have given to the half tribe of Ma·nas′seh.
