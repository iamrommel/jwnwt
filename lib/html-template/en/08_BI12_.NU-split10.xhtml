    </span>And Jehovah proceeded to speak to Moses, saying: <a id="chapter10_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>“Make for yourself two trumpets of silver. You will make them of hammered work, and they must be at your service for convening the assembly and for breaking up the camps. <a id="chapter10_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>And they must blow on them both, and the whole assembly must keep their appointment with you at the entrance of the tent of meeting. <a id="chapter10_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>And if they should blow on just one, the chieftains as heads of the thousands of Israel must also keep their appointment with you.</p>

    </b>Then Moses said to Ho′bab the son of Reu′el the Mid′i·an·ite, the father-in-law of Moses: “We are pulling away for the place about which Jehovah said, ‘I shall give it to <span class="smcap">YOU</span>.’ Do come with us, and we shall certainly do good to you, because Jehovah has spoken good concerning Israel.” <a id="chapter10_verse30"></a><b><sup>30 </sup></b>But he said to him: “I shall not go along, but I shall go to my own country and to my relatives.” <a id="chapter10_verse31"></a><b><sup>31 </sup></b>At this he said: “Please, do not leave us, because, for the reason that you well know where we may encamp in the wilderness, you must serve as eyes for us. <a id="chapter10_verse32"></a><b><sup>32 </sup></b>And it must occur that in case you should come with us, yes, it must occur that with what goodness Jehovah will do good with us, we, in turn, will do good to you.”</p>
