    </span>At that time Mer′o·dach-bal′a·dan the son of Bal′a·dan the king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hez·e·ki′ah, after he heard that he had been sick but was strong again. <a id="chapter39_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>So Hez·e·ki′ah began to rejoice over them and proceeded to show them his treasure-house, the silver and the gold and the balsam oil and the good oil and all his armory and all that was to be found in his treasures. There proved to be nothing that Hez·e·ki′ah did not show them in his own house and in all his dominion.</p>

    </b>After that Isaiah the prophet came in to King Hez·e·ki′ah and said to him: “What did these men say, and from where did they proceed to come to you?” So Hez·e·ki′ah said: “From a distant land they came to me, from Babylon.” <a id="chapter39_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>And he went on to say: “What did they see in your house?” To this Hez·e·ki′ah said: “Everything that is in my house they saw. There proved to be nothing that I did not show them in my treasures.” <a id="chapter39_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>Isaiah now said to Hez·e·ki′ah: “Hear the word of Jehovah of armies, <a id="chapter39_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>‘Look! Days are coming, and all that is in your own house and that your forefathers have stored up down to this day will actually be carried to Babylon.’ ‘Nothing will be left,’ Jehovah has said. <a id="chapter39_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>‘And some of your own sons that will come forth from you, to whom you will become father, will themselves be taken and actually become court officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”</p>
