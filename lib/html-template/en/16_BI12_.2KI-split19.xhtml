    </span>And it came about that as soon as King Hez·e·ki′ah heard, he immediately ripped his garments apart and covered himself with sackcloth and came into the house of Jehovah. <a id="chapter19_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>Further, he sent E·li′a·kim, who was over the household, and Sheb′nah the secretary and the older men of the priests covered with sackcloth to Isaiah the prophet the son of A′moz. <a id="chapter19_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>And they proceeded to say to him: “This is what Hez·e·ki′ah has said, ‘This day is a day of distress and of rebuke and of scornful insolence; for the sons have come as far as the womb’s mouth, and there is no power to give birth. <a id="chapter19_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>Perhaps Jehovah your God will hear all the words of Rab′sha·keh, whom the king of As·syr′i·a his lord sent to taunt the living God, and he will actually call him to account for the words that Jehovah your God has heard. And you must lift up prayer in behalf of the remnant that are to be found.’”</p>

      <sup>5 </sup>
    </b>So the servants of King Hez·e·ki′ah came in to Isaiah. <a id="chapter19_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>Then Isaiah said to them: “This is what <span class="smcap">YOU </span>should say to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>lord, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard with which the attendants of the king of As·syr′i·a spoke abusively of me. <a id="chapter19_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>Here I am putting a spirit in him, and he must hear a report and return to his own land; and I shall certainly cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”</p>

    </b>After that Rab′sha·keh returned and found the king of As·syr′i·a fighting against Lib′nah; for he had heard that he had pulled away from La′chish. <a id="chapter19_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>He heard it said respecting Tir·ha′kah the king of E·thi·o′pi·a: “Here he has come out to fight against you.” Therefore he sent messengers again to Hez·e·ki′ah, saying: <a id="chapter19_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>“This is what <span class="smcap">YOU </span>men should say to Hez·e·ki′ah the king of Judah, ‘Do not let your God in whom you are trusting deceive you, saying: “Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of As·syr′i·a.” <a id="chapter19_verse11"></a><b><sup>11 </sup></b>Look! You yourself have heard what the kings of As·syr′i·a did to all the lands by devoting them to destruction; and will you yourself be delivered? <a id="chapter19_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>Have the gods of the nations that my forefathers brought to ruin delivered them, even Go′zan and Ha′ran and Re′zeph and the sons of E′den that were in Tel-as′sar? <a id="chapter19_verse13"></a><b><sup>13 </sup></b>Where is he—the king of Ha′math and the king of Ar′pad and the king of the cities of Seph·ar·va′im, He′na and Iv′vah?’”</p>
  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter19_verse14"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>14 </sup>
    </b>Then Hez·e·ki′ah took the letters out of the hand of the messengers and read them, after which Hez·e·ki′ah went up to the house of Jehovah and spread it out before Jehovah. <a id="chapter19_verse15"></a><b><sup>15 </sup></b>And Hez·e·ki′ah began to pray before <a id="page525"></a>Jehovah and say: “O Jehovah the God of Israel, sitting upon the cherubs, you alone are the true God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You yourself have made the heavens and the earth. <a id="chapter19_verse16"></a><b><sup>16 </sup></b>Incline your ear, O Jehovah, and hear. Open your eyes, O Jehovah, and see, and hear the words of Sen·nach′er·ib that he has sent to taunt the living God. <a id="chapter19_verse17"></a><b><sup>17 </sup></b>It is a fact, O Jehovah, the kings of As·syr′i·a have devastated the nations and their land. <a id="chapter19_verse18"></a><b><sup>18 </sup></b>And they have consigned their gods to the fire, because they were no gods, but the workmanship of man’s hands, wood and stone; so that they destroyed them. <a id="chapter19_verse19"></a><b><sup>19 </sup></b>And now, O Jehovah our God, save us, please, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Jehovah, are God alone.”</p>

    </b>And Isaiah the son of A′moz proceeded to send to Hez·e·ki′ah, saying: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘The prayer that you have made to me concerning Sen·nach′er·ib the king of As·syr′i·a I have heard. <a id="chapter19_verse21"></a><b><sup>21 </sup></b>This is the word that Jehovah has spoken against him:</p>
