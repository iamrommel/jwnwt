    </span>Now these were the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Jehovah spoke with Moses in Mount Si′nai. <a id="chapter3_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>And these were the names of Aaron’s sons: the firstborn Na′dab and A·bi′hu, El·e·a′zar and Ith′a·mar. <a id="chapter3_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>These were the names of Aaron’s sons, the anointed priests whose hands had been filled with power to act as priests. <a id="chapter3_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>However, Na′dab and A·bi′hu died before Jehovah when they offered illegitimate fire before Jehovah in the wilderness of Si′nai; and they did not come to have any sons. But El·e·a′zar and Ith′a·mar continued to act as priests along with Aaron their father.</p>

    <b>
      <sup>5 </sup>
    </b>And Jehovah proceeded to speak to Moses, saying: <a id="chapter3_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>“Bring the tribe of Le′vi near, and you must stand them before Aaron the priest, and they must minister to him. <a id="chapter3_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>And they must keep their obligation to him and their obligation to all the assembly before the tent of meeting in discharging the service of the tabernacle. <a id="chapter3_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>And they must take care of all the utensils of the tent of meeting, even the obligation of the sons of Israel in discharging the service of the tabernacle. <a id="chapter3_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>And you must give the Levites to Aaron and his sons. They are given ones, given to him from the sons of Israel. <a id="chapter3_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>And you should appoint Aaron and his sons, and they must take care of their priesthood; and any stranger coming near should be put to death.”</p>
  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter3_verse11"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>11 </sup>
    </b>And Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: <a id="chapter3_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>“As for me, look! I do take the Levites from among the sons of Israel in place of all the firstborn opening the womb of the sons of Israel; and the Levites must become mine. <a id="chapter3_verse13"></a><b><sup>13 </sup></b>For every firstborn is mine. In the day that I struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified to myself every firstborn in Israel from man to beast. They should become mine. I am Jehovah.”</p>

    <a id="chapter3_verse14"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>14 </sup>
    </b>And Jehovah spoke further to Moses in the wilderness of Si′nai, saying: <a id="chapter3_verse15"></a><b><sup>15 </sup></b>“Register the sons of Le′vi according to the house of their fathers by their families. Every male from a month old upward you should register.” <a id="chapter3_verse16"></a><b><sup>16 </sup></b>And Moses began to register them at the order of Jehovah, just as he had been commanded. <a id="chapter3_verse17"></a><b><sup>17 </sup></b>And these came to be the sons of Le′vi by their names: Ger′shon and Ko′hath and Me·rar′i.</p>
  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter3_verse18"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>18 </sup>

  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter3_verse19"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>19 </sup>

  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter3_verse20"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>20 </sup>

    <a id="chapter3_verse21"></a>
    <b>
      <sup>21 </sup>

These were the families of the Ko′hath·ites. <a id="chapter3_verse28"></a><b><sup>28 </sup></b>Among the number of all the males from a month old upward there were eight thousand six hundred, taking care of the obligation to the holy place. <a id="chapter3_verse29"></a><b><sup>29 </sup></b>The families of the sons of Ko′hath were encamped on the side of the tabernacle to the south. <a id="chapter3_verse30"></a><b><sup>30 </sup></b>And the chieftain of the paternal house for the families of the Ko′hath·ites was E·li·za′phan the son of Uz′zi·el. <a id="chapter3_verse31"></a><b><sup>31 </sup></b>And their obligation was the Ark and the table and the lampstand and the altars and the utensils of the holy place with which they would minister and the screen, and all its service.</p>
  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter3_verse32"></a>
    <b>

  <p class="sb">
    <a id="chapter3_verse44"></a>
    <b>

In the shekel of the holy place you should take it. A shekel is twenty ge′rahs. <a id="chapter3_verse48"></a><b><sup>48 </sup></b>And you must give the money to Aaron and his sons as the ransom price of those who are in excess of them.” <a id="chapter3_verse49"></a><b><sup>49 </sup></b>So Moses took the money of the redemption price from those who were in excess of the ransom price of the Levites. <a id="chapter3_verse50"></a><b><sup>50 </sup></b>From the firstborn of the sons of Israel he took the money, a thousand three hundred and sixty-five shekels, in the shekel of the holy place. <a id="chapter3_verse51"></a><b><sup>51 </sup></b>Then Moses gave the money of the ransom price to Aaron and his sons according to the order of Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</p>
