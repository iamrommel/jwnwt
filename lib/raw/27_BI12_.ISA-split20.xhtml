<p class="w_biblebookname">Isaiah</p><p class="sb"><a id="chapter20"></a><a id="chapter20_verse1"></a><span class="w_ch"><b>20 </b></span>In the year that Tar′tan came to Ash′dod, when Sar′gon the king of As·syr′i·a sent him, and he proceeded to war against Ash′dod and to capture it; <a id="chapter20_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>at that time Jehovah spoke by the hand of Isaiah the son of A′moz, saying: “Go, and you must loosen the sackcloth <a id="page909"></a>from off your hips; and your sandals you should draw from off your feet.” And he proceeded to do so, walking about naked and barefoot.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter20_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>And Jehovah went on to say: “Just as my servant Isaiah has walked about naked and barefoot three years as a sign and a portent against Egypt and against E·thi·o′pi·a, <a id="chapter20_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>so the king of As·syr′i·a will lead the body of captives of Egypt and the exiles of E·thi·o′pi·a, boys and old men, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks stripped, the nakedness of Egypt. <a id="chapter20_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>And they will certainly be terrified and be ashamed of E·thi·o′pi·a their looked-for hope and of Egypt their beauty. <a id="chapter20_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>And the inhabitant of this coastland will be certain to say in that day, ‘There is how our looked-for hope is, to which we fled for assistance, in order to be delivered because of the king of As·syr′i·a! And how shall we ourselves escape?’”</p>
