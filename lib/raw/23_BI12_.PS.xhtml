<p class="ss">(Psalms 1 â€“ 41)</p>
<p class="sl"><a id="chapter1"></a><a id="chapter1_verse1"></a><span class="w_ch"><b>1 </b></span>Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones,</p>
<p class="sz">And in the way of sinners has not stood,</p>
<p class="sz">And in the seat of ridiculers has not sat.</p>
<p class="sl"><a id="chapter1_verse2"></a> <b><sup>2 </sup></b>But his delight is in the law of Jehovah,</p>
<p class="sz">And in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.</p>
<p class="sl"><a id="chapter1_verse3"></a> <b><sup>3 </sup></b>And he will certainly become like a tree planted by streams of water,</p>
<p class="sz">That gives its own fruit in its season</p>
<p class="sp">And the foliage of which does not wither,</p>
<p class="sz">And everything he does will succeed.</p>
<p class="sl"><a id="chapter1_verse4"></a> <b><sup>4 </sup></b>The wicked are not like that,</p>
<p class="sz">But are like the chaff that the wind drives away.</p>
<p class="sl"><a id="chapter1_verse5"></a> <b><sup>5 </sup></b>That is why the wicked ones will not stand up in the judgment,</p>
<p class="sz">Nor sinners in the assembly of righteous ones.</p>
<p class="sl"><a id="chapter1_verse6"></a> <b><sup>6 </sup></b>For Jehovah is taking knowledge of the way of righteous ones,</p>
<p class="sz">But the very way of wicked ones will perish.</p>
