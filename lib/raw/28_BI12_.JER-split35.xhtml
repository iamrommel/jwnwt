<p class="w_biblebookname">Jeremiah</p><p class="sb"><a id="chapter35"></a><a id="chapter35_verse1"></a><span class="w_ch"><b>35 </b></span>The word that occurred to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Je·hoi′a·kim the son of Jo·si′ah, the king of Judah, saying: <a id="chapter35_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>“Go to the house of the Re′cha·bites, and you must speak with them and bring them into the house of Jehovah, to one of the dining rooms; and you must give them wine to drink.”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter35_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>So I took Ja·az·a·ni′ah the son of Jeremiah the son of Hab·az·zi·ni′ah and his brothers, and all his sons, and all the household of the Re′cha·bites, <a id="chapter35_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>and I proceeded to bring them into the house of Jehovah, to the dining room of the sons of Ha′nan the son of Ig·da·li′ah, a man of the true God, which was beside the dining room of the princes that was above the dining room of Ma·a·sei′ah the son of Shal′lum the doorkeeper. <a id="chapter35_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>Then I put before the sons of the house of the Re′cha·bites cups full of wine and goblets and said to them: “Drink wine.”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter35_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>But they said: “We shall drink no wine, because Jon′a·dab the son of Re′chab, our forefather, was the one that laid the command upon us, saying, ‘Y<span class="smcap">OU </span>must drink no wine, neither <span class="smcap">YOU </span>nor <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>sons, to time indefinite. <a id="chapter35_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>And no house must <span class="smcap">YOU </span>build, and no seed must <span class="smcap">YOU </span>sow; and no vineyard must <span class="smcap">YOU </span>plant, nor must it come to be <span class="smcap">YOURS</span>. But in tents <span class="smcap">YOU </span>should dwell all <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>days, in order that <span class="smcap">YOU </span>may keep living many days upon the surface of the ground where <span class="smcap">YOU </span>are residing as aliens.’ <a id="chapter35_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>So we keep obeying the voice of Je·hon′a·dab the son of Re′chab our forefather in everything that he commanded us by drinking no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons and our daughters, <a id="chapter35_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>and by not building houses for us to dwell in, so that no vineyard or field or seed should become ours. <a id="chapter35_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>And we keep dwelling in tents and obeying and doing according to all that Jon′a·dab our forefather commanded us. <a id="chapter35_verse11"></a><b><sup>11 </sup></b>But it came about when Neb·u·chad·rez′zar the king of Babylon came up against the land that we began to say, ‘Come, and let us enter into Jerusalem because of the military force of the Chal·de′ans and because of the military force of the Syrians, and let us dwell in Jerusalem.’”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter35_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>And the word of Jehovah proceeded to occur to Jeremiah, saying: <a id="chapter35_verse13"></a><b><sup>13 </sup></b>“This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Go, and you must say to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: “Did <span class="smcap">YOU </span>not continually receive exhortation to obey my words?” is the utterance of Jehovah. <a id="chapter35_verse14"></a><b><sup>14 </sup></b>“There has been a carrying out of the words of Je·hon′a·dab the son of Re′chab, that he commanded his sons, to drink no wine, and they have drunk none down to this day, because <a id="page1017"></a>they have obeyed the commandment of their forefather. And as for me, I have spoken to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>men, rising up early and speaking, but <span class="smcap">YOU </span>have not obeyed me. <a id="chapter35_verse15"></a><b><sup>15 </sup></b>And I kept sending to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, ‘Turn back, please, each one from his bad way, and make <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>dealings good, and do not walk after other gods to serve them. And keep dwelling on the ground that I have given to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>and to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>forefathers.’ But <span class="smcap">YOU </span>did not incline <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>ear, nor did <span class="smcap">YOU </span>listen to me. <a id="chapter35_verse16"></a><b><sup>16 </sup></b>But the sons of Je·hon′a·dab the son of Re′chab have carried out the commandment of their forefather that he commanded them; but as for this people, they have not listened to me.”’”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter35_verse17"></a><b><sup>17 </sup></b>“Therefore this is what Jehovah, the God of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Here I am bringing upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the calamity that I have spoken against them, for the reason that I have spoken to them but they did not listen, and I kept calling to them but they did not answer.’”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter35_verse18"></a><b><sup>18 </sup></b>And to the household of the Re′cha·bites Jeremiah said: “This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘For the reason that <span class="smcap">YOU </span>have obeyed the commandment of Je·hon′a·dab <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>forefather and continue keeping all his commandments and doing according to all that he commanded <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, <a id="chapter35_verse19"></a><b><sup>19 </sup></b>therefore this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said: “There will not be cut off from Jon′a·dab the son of Re′chab a man to stand before me always.”’”</p>
