<p class="w_biblebookname">Luke</p><p class="sb"><a id="chapter3"></a><a id="chapter3_verse1"></a><span class="w_ch"><b>3 </b></span>In the fifteenth year of the reign of Ti·be′ri·us Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Ju·de′a, and Herod was district ruler of Gal′i·lee, but Philip his brother was district ruler of the country of It·u·rae′a and Trach·o·ni′tis, and Ly·sa′ni·as was district ruler of Ab·i·le′ne, <a id="chapter3_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>in the days of chief priest An′nas and of Ca′ia·phas, God’s declaration came to John the son of Zech·a·ri′ah in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter3_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>So he came into all the country around the Jordan, preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins, <a id="chapter3_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>just as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: “Listen! Someone is crying out in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of Jehovah, <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people, make his roads straight. <a id="chapter3_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>Every gully must be filled up, and every mountain and hill leveled down, and the curves must become straight ways and the rough places smooth ways; <a id="chapter3_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>and all flesh will see the saving means of God.’”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter3_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>Therefore he began to say to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him: “Y<span class="smcap">OU </span>offspring of vipers, who has intimated <a id="page1288"></a>to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>to flee from the coming wrath? <a id="chapter3_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>Therefore produce fruits that befit repentance. And do not start saying within yourselves, ‘As a father we have Abraham.’ For I say to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>that God has power to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. <a id="chapter3_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>Indeed, the ax is already in position at the root of the trees; every tree, therefore, not producing fine fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire.”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter3_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>And the crowds would ask him: “What, then, shall we do?” <a id="chapter3_verse11"></a><b><sup>11 </sup></b>In reply he would say to them: “Let the man that has two undergarments share with the man that has none, and let him that has things to eat do the same.” <a id="chapter3_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>But even tax collectors came to be baptized, and they said to him: “Teacher, what shall we do?” <a id="chapter3_verse13"></a><b><sup>13 </sup></b>He said to them: “Do not demand anything more than the tax rate.” <a id="chapter3_verse14"></a><b><sup>14 </sup></b>Also, those in military service would ask him: “What shall we also do?” And he said to them: “Do not harass anybody or accuse anybody falsely, but be satisfied with <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>provisions.”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter3_verse15"></a><b><sup>15 </sup></b>Now as the people were in expectation and all were reasoning in their hearts about John: “May he perhaps be the Christ?” <a id="chapter3_verse16"></a><b><sup>16 </sup></b>John gave the answer, saying to all: “I, for my part, baptize <span class="smcap">YOU </span>with water; but the one stronger than I am is coming, the lace of whose sandals I am not fit to untie. He will baptize <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people with holy spirit and fire. <a id="chapter3_verse17"></a><b><sup>17 </sup></b>His winnowing shovel is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor completely and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out.”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter3_verse18"></a><b><sup>18 </sup></b>Therefore he also gave many other exhortations and continued declaring good news to the people. <a id="chapter3_verse19"></a><b><sup>19 </sup></b>But Herod the district ruler, for being reproved by him concerning He·ro′di·as the wife of his brother and concerning all the wicked deeds that Herod did, <a id="chapter3_verse20"></a><b><sup>20 </sup></b>added also this to all those deeds: he locked John up in prison.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter3_verse21"></a><b><sup>21 </sup></b>Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized and, as he was praying, the heaven was opened up <a id="chapter3_verse22"></a><b><sup>22 </sup></b>and the holy spirit in bodily shape like a dove came down upon him, and a voice came out of heaven: “You are my Son, the beloved; I have approved you.”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter3_verse23"></a><b><sup>23 </sup></b>Furthermore, Jesus himself, when he commenced his work, was about thirty years old, being the son, as the opinion was,</p>
