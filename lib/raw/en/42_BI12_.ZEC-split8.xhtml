<p class="w_biblebookname">Zechariah</p><p class="sb"><a id="chapter8"></a><a id="chapter8_verse1"></a><span class="w_ch"><b>8 </b></span>And the word of Jehovah of armies continued to occur, saying: <a id="chapter8_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>“This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘I will be jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and with great rage I will be jealous for her.’”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter8_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>“This is what Jehovah has said, ‘I will return to Zion and reside in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem will certainly be called the city of trueness, and the mountain of Jehovah of armies, the holy mountain.’”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter8_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>“This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘There will yet sit old men and old women in the public squares of Jerusalem, <a id="page1205"></a>each one also with his staff in his hand because of the abundance of his days. <a id="chapter8_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>And the public squares of the city themselves will be filled with boys and girls playing in her public squares.’”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter8_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>“This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘Although it should seem too difficult in the eyes of the remaining ones of this people in those days, should it seem too difficult also in my eyes?’ is the utterance of Jehovah of armies.”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter8_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>“This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘Here I am saving my people from the land of the sunrise and from the land of the setting of the sun. <a id="chapter8_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>And I shall certainly bring them in, and they must reside in the midst of Jerusalem; and they must become my people, and I myself shall become their God in trueness and in righteousness.’”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter8_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>“This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘Let the hands of <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people be strong, <span class="smcap">YOU </span>who are hearing in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets, on the day on which the foundation of the house of Jehovah of armies was laid, for the temple to be built. <a id="chapter8_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>For before those days there were no wages for mankind made to exist; and as for the wages of domestic animals, there was no such thing; and to the one going out and to the one coming in there was no peace because of the adversary, as I kept thrusting all mankind against one another.’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter8_verse11"></a><b><sup>11 </sup></b>“‘And now I shall not be as in the former days to the remaining ones of this people,’ is the utterance of Jehovah of armies. <a id="chapter8_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>‘For there will be the seed of peace; the vine itself will give its fruitage, and the earth itself will give its yield, and the heavens themselves will give their dew; and I shall certainly cause the remaining ones of this people to inherit all these things. <a id="chapter8_verse13"></a><b><sup>13 </sup></b>And it must occur that just as <span class="smcap">YOU </span>became a malediction among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I shall save <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, and <span class="smcap">YOU </span>must become a blessing. Do not be afraid. May <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>hands be strong.’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter8_verse14"></a><b><sup>14 </sup></b>“For this is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘“Just as I had in mind to do what was calamitous to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people because of <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>forefathers’ making me indignant,” Jehovah of armies has said, “and I felt no regret, <a id="chapter8_verse15"></a><b><sup>15 </sup></b>so I will again have in mind in these days to deal well with Jerusalem and with the house of Judah. Do not be afraid.”’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter8_verse16"></a><b><sup>16 </sup></b>“‘These are the things that <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people should do: Speak truthfully with one another. With truth and the judgment of peace do <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>judging in <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>gates. <a id="chapter8_verse17"></a><b><sup>17 </sup></b>And calamity to one another do not <span class="smcap">YOU </span>scheme up in <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>hearts, and do not love any false oath; for these are all things that I have hated,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter8_verse18"></a><b><sup>18 </sup></b>And the word of Jehovah of armies continued to occur to me, saying: <a id="chapter8_verse19"></a><b><sup>19 </sup></b>“This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth month, and the fast of the seventh month, and the fast of the tenth month will become for the house of Judah an exultation and a rejoicing and good festal seasons. So love truth and peace.’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter8_verse20"></a><b><sup>20 </sup></b>“This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘It will yet be that peoples and the inhabitants of many cities will come; <a id="chapter8_verse21"></a><b><sup>21 </sup></b>and the inhabitants of one city will certainly go to those of <a id="page1206"></a>another, saying: “Let us earnestly go to soften the face of Jehovah and to seek Jehovah of armies. I myself will go also.” <a id="chapter8_verse22"></a><b><sup>22 </sup></b>And many peoples and mighty nations will actually come to seek Jehovah of armies in Jerusalem and to soften the face of Jehovah.’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter8_verse23"></a><b><sup>23 </sup></b>“This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘It will be in those days that ten men out of all the languages of the nations will take hold, yes, they will actually take hold of the skirt of a man who is a Jew, saying: “We will go with <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people, for we have heard that God is with <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people.”’”</p>
