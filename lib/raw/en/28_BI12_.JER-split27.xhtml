<p class="sb">“‘“This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said; this is what <span class="smcap">YOU </span>should say to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>masters, <a id="chapter27_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>‘I myself have made the earth, mankind and the beasts that are upon the surface of the earth by my great power and by my stretched-out arm; and I have given it to whom it has proved right in my eyes. <a id="chapter27_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>And now I myself have given all these lands into the hand of Neb·u·chad·nez′zar the king of Babylon, my servant; and even the wild beasts of the field I have given him to serve him. <a id="chapter27_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>And all the nations must serve even him and his son and his grandson until the time even of his own land comes, and many nations and great kings must exploit him as a servant.’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter27_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>“‘“‘And it must occur that the nation and the kingdom that will not serve him, even Neb·u·chad·nez′zar the king of Babylon; and the one that will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, with the sword and with the famine and with the pestilence I shall turn my attention upon that nation,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘until I shall have finished them off by his hand.’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter27_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>“‘“‘And as for <span class="smcap">YOU </span>men, do not listen to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>prophets and to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>practicers of divination and to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>dreamers and to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>practicers of magic and to <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>sorcerers, who are saying to <span class="smcap">YOU</span>: “Y<span class="smcap">OU </span>men will not serve the king of Babylon.” <a id="chapter27_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>For falsehood is what they are prophesying to <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, for the purpose of having <span class="smcap">YOU </span>taken far away from off <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>ground; and I shall have to disperse <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, and <span class="smcap">YOU </span>will have to perish.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter27_verse11"></a><b><sup>11 </sup></b>“‘“‘And as for the nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and actually serve him, I will also let it rest upon its ground,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and it will certainly cultivate it and dwell in it.’”’”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter27_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>Even to Zed·e·ki′ah the king of Judah I spoke according to all these words, saying: “Bring <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people and keep on living. <a id="chapter27_verse13"></a><b><sup>13 </sup></b>Why should you yourself and your people die by the sword, by the famine <a id="page1003"></a>and by the pestilence according to what Jehovah has spoken to the nation that does not serve the king of Babylon? <a id="chapter27_verse14"></a><b><sup>14 </sup></b>And do not listen to the words of the prophets that are saying to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>men, ‘Y<span class="smcap">OU </span>will not serve the king of Babylon,’ because falsehood is what they are prophesying to <span class="smcap">YOU</span>.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter27_verse15"></a><b><sup>15 </sup></b>“‘For I have not sent them,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘but they are prophesying in my name falsely, to the end that I shall disperse <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, and <span class="smcap">YOU </span>will have to perish, <span class="smcap">YOU </span>men and the prophets that are prophesying to <span class="smcap">YOU</span>.’”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter27_verse16"></a><b><sup>16 </sup></b>And to the priests and to all this people I spoke, saying: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Do not listen to the words of <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>prophets that are prophesying to <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, saying: “Look! The utensils of the house of Jehovah are being brought back from Babylon soon now!” For falsehood is what they are prophesying to <span class="smcap">YOU</span>. <a id="chapter27_verse17"></a><b><sup>17 </sup></b>Do not listen to them.

Why should this city become a devastated place? <a id="chapter27_verse18"></a><b><sup>18 </sup></b>But if they are prophets and if the word of Jehovah does exist with them, let them, please, beseech Jehovah of armies, that the utensils that are remaining over in the house of Jehovah and the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem may not come into Babylon.’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter27_verse19"></a><b><sup>19 </sup></b>“For this is what Jehovah of armies has said concerning the pillars and concerning the sea and concerning the carriages and concerning the remainder of the utensils that are remaining over in this city, <a id="chapter27_verse20"></a><b><sup>20 </sup></b>that Neb·u·chad·nez′zar the king of Babylon had not taken when he carried Jec·o·ni′ah the son of Je·hoi′a·kim, the king of Judah, into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, together with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; <a id="chapter27_verse21"></a><b><sup>21 </sup></b>for this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said concerning the utensils that are remaining over at the house of Jehovah and the house of the king of Judah and Jerusalem, <a id="chapter27_verse22"></a><b><sup>22 </sup></b>‘“To Babylon is where they will be brought and there they will continue to be until the day of my turning my attention to them,” is the utterance of Jehovah. “And I will bring them up and restore them to this place.”’”</p>
