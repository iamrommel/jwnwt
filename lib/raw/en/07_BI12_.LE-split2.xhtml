<p class="sb"><a id="chapter2_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>“‘And in case you would present as an offering a grain offering in the way of something baked in the oven, it should be of fine flour, unfermented ring-shaped cakes moistened with oil or unfermented wafers smeared with oil.</p>

It is a grain offering.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter2_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>“‘And if your offering is a grain offering out of the deep-fat kettle, it should be made of fine flour with oil. <a id="chapter2_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>And you must bring the grain offering that was made of these to Jehovah; and it must be presented to the priest and he must bring it near to the altar. <a id="chapter2_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>And the priest must lift off some of the grain offering as a remembrancer of it and must make it smoke on the altar, as an offering made by fire of a restful odor to Jehovah. <a id="chapter2_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>And what is left of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons, as something most holy of Jehovah’s offerings by fire.</p>
