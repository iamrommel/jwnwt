<p class="w_biblebookname">Ezekiel</p><p class="sb"><a id="chapter20"></a><a id="chapter20_verse1"></a><span class="w_ch"><b>20 </b></span>Now it came about in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that men from the elderly ones of Israel came in to inquire of Jehovah, and they proceeded to sit down before me. <a id="chapter20_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>Then the word of Jehovah occurred to me, saying: <a id="chapter20_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>“Son of man, speak with the elderly men of Israel, and you must say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Is it in order to inquire of me that <span class="smcap">YOU </span>men are coming? ‘As I am alive, I will not be inquired of by <span class="smcap">YOU</span>,’ <a id="page1082"></a>is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter20_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>“Will you judge them? Will you judge them, O son of man? Cause them to know the detestable things of their forefathers. <a id="chapter20_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>And you must say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “In the day of my choosing Israel, I also proceeded to lift up my hand in an oath to the seed of the house of Jacob and to make myself known to them in the land of Egypt. Yes, I proceeded to lift up my hand in an oath to them, saying, ‘I am Jehovah <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>God.’ <a id="chapter20_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>In that day I lifted up my hand in an oath to them to bring them forth from the land of Egypt to a land that I had spied out for them, one flowing with milk and honey. It was the decoration of all the lands. <a id="chapter20_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>And I went on to say to them, ‘Throw away, each one of <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, the disgusting things of his eyes, and with the dungy idols of Egypt do not defile yourselves. I am Jehovah <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>God.’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter20_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>“‘“And they began to rebel against me, and they did not consent to listen to me. The disgusting things of their eyes they did not individually throw away, and the dungy idols of Egypt they did not leave, so that I promised to pour out my rage upon them, in order to bring my anger to its finish upon them in the midst of the land of Egypt. <a id="chapter20_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>And I went acting for the sake of my own name that it might not be profaned before the eyes of the nations in among whom they were, because I had made myself known to them before their eyes on bringing them forth from the land of Egypt. <a id="chapter20_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>So I brought them forth from the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter20_verse11"></a><b><sup>11 </sup></b>“‘“And I proceeded to give them my statutes; and my judicial decisions I made known to them, in order that the man who keeps doing them might also keep living by them. <a id="chapter20_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>And my sabbaths I also gave to them, to become a sign between me and them, in order for them to know that I am Jehovah who is sanctifying them.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter20_verse13"></a><b><sup>13 </sup></b>“‘“But they, the house of Israel, rebelled against me in the wilderness. In my statutes they did not walk, and my judicial decisions they rejected, which, should the man keep doing, he will also keep living by them. And my sabbaths they profaned very much, so that I promised to pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, in order to exterminate them. <a id="chapter20_verse14"></a><b><sup>14 </sup></b>But I acted for the sake of my own name that it might not be profaned before the eyes of the nations, before whose eyes I had brought them forth. <a id="chapter20_verse15"></a><b><sup>15 </sup></b>And I myself also lifted up my hand in an oath to them in the wilderness, not to bring them into the land that I had given, one flowing with milk and honey, (it is the decoration of all the lands,) <a id="chapter20_verse16"></a><b><sup>16 </sup></b>for the reason that they rejected my own judicial decisions; and as regards my statutes, they did not walk in them, and my sabbaths they profaned, because it was after their dungy idols that their heart was going.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter20_verse17"></a><b><sup>17 </sup></b>“‘“And my eye began to feel sorry for them to keep me from bringing them to ruin, and I did not make an extermination of them in the wilderness. <a id="chapter20_verse18"></a><b><sup>18 </sup></b>And I proceeded to say to their sons in the wilderness, ‘In the regulations of <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>forefathers do not <span class="smcap">YOU </span>walk, and their judgments do not <span class="smcap">YOU </span>keep, and with their dungy idols do not <a id="page1083"></a><span class="smcap">YOU </span>defile yourselves. <a id="chapter20_verse19"></a><b><sup>19 </sup></b>I am Jehovah <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>God.
