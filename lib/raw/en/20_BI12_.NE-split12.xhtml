<p class="sb"><a id="chapter12_verse31"></a><b><sup>31 </sup></b>Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall.

<p class="sb"><a id="chapter12_verse38"></a><b><sup>38 </sup></b>And the other thanksgiving choir was walking in front, and I after it, also half of the people, upon the wall up over the Tower of the Bake Ovens and on to the Broad Wall, <a id="chapter12_verse39"></a><b><sup>39 </sup></b>and up over the Gate of E′phra·im and on to the Gate of the Old City and clear to the Fish Gate and the Tower of Ha·nan′el and the Tower of Me′ah and on to the Sheep Gate; and they came to a stand at the Gate of the Guard.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter12_verse40"></a><b><sup>40 </sup></b>At length the two thanksgiving choirs came to a stand at the house of the true God, also I and half of the deputy rulers with me, <a id="chapter12_verse41"></a><b><sup>41 </sup></b>and the priests E·li′a·kim, Ma·a·sei′ah, Mi·ni′a·min, Mi·cai′ah, Eli·o·e′nai, Zech·a·ri′ah, Han·a·ni′ah with the trumpets, <a id="chapter12_verse42"></a><b><sup>42 </sup></b>and Ma·a·sei′ah and She·mai′ah, and El·e·a′zar and Uz′zi and Je·ho·ha′nan and Mal·chi′jah and E′lam and E′zer.

<p class="sb"><a id="chapter12_verse43"></a><b><sup>43 </sup></b>And they proceeded to sacrifice on that day great sacrifices and to rejoice, for the true God himself caused them to rejoice with great joy. And also the women and the children themselves rejoiced, so that the rejoicing of Jerusalem could be heard far away.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter12_verse44"></a><b><sup>44 </sup></b>Further, there were appointed on that day men over the halls for the stores, for the contributions, for the firstfruits and for the tenths, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions called for by the law for the priests and the Levites; for the rejoicing of Judah was because of the priests and of the Levites who were in attendance. <a id="chapter12_verse45"></a><b><sup>45 </sup></b>And they began taking care of the obligation of their God and the obligation of the purification, also the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the commandment of David and Sol′o·mon his son. <a id="chapter12_verse46"></a><b><sup>46 </sup></b>For in the days of David <a id="page657"></a>and A′saph in bygone time there were heads of the singers and the song of praise and thanksgivings to God. <a id="chapter12_verse47"></a><b><sup>47 </sup></b>And all Israel during the days of Ze·rub′ba·bel and during the days of Ne·he·mi′ah were giving the portions of the singers and of the gatekeepers according to the daily need and were sanctifying them to the Levites; and the Levites were sanctifying them to the sons of Aaron.</p>
