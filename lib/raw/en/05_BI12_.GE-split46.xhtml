Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I shall constitute you there into a great nation. <a id="chapter46_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>I myself shall go down with you to Egypt and I myself shall surely bring you up also; and Joseph will lay his hand upon your eyes.”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="page70"></a><a id="chapter46_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>After that Jacob got up out of Be′er-she′ba, and the sons of Israel continued transporting Jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons that Phar′aoh had sent to transport him. <a id="chapter46_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>Further, they took along their herds and their goods, which they had accumulated in the land of Ca′naan. Eventually they came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him. <a id="chapter46_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>He brought his sons and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters and his sons’ daughters, even all his offspring, with him into Egypt.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter46_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>Now these are the names of Israel’s sons who came into Egypt: Jacob and his sons: Jacob’s firstborn was Reu′ben.</p>

<p class="sb"><a id="chapter46_verse17"></a><b><sup>17 </sup></b>And the sons of Ash′er were Im′nah and Ish′vah and Ish′vi and Be·ri′ah, and there was Se′rah their sister.</p>
<p class="sb">And the sons of Be·ri′ah were He′ber and Mal′chi·el.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter46_verse18"></a><b><sup>18 </sup></b>These are the sons of Zil′pah, whom La′ban gave to his daughter Le′ah. In time she bore these to Jacob: sixteen souls.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter46_verse19"></a><b><sup>19 </sup></b>The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife, were Joseph and Benjamin.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter46_verse20"></a><b><sup>20 </sup></b>And there came to be born to Joseph in the land of Egypt Ma·nas′seh and E′phra·im, whom As′e·nath the daughter of Pot·i′phe·ra the priest of On bore to him.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter46_verse21"></a><b><sup>21 </sup></b>And the sons of Benjamin were Be′la and Be′cher and Ash′bel, Ge′ra and Na′a·man, E′hi and Rosh, Mup′pim and Hup′pim and Ard.</p>

<p class="sb"><a id="chapter46_verse28"></a><b><sup>28 </sup></b>And he sent Judah in advance of him to Joseph to impart information ahead of him to Go′shen. After that they came into <a id="page71"></a>the land of Go′shen. <a id="chapter46_verse29"></a><b><sup>29 </sup></b>Then Joseph had his chariot made ready and went up to meet Israel his father at Go′shen. When he appeared to him he at once fell upon his neck and gave way to tears upon his neck again and again. <a id="chapter46_verse30"></a><b><sup>30 </sup></b>Finally Israel said to Joseph: “This time I am willing to die, now that I have seen your face, since you are still alive.”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter46_verse31"></a><b><sup>31 </sup></b>Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household: “Let me go up and report to Phar′aoh and say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Ca′naan have come here to me. <a id="chapter46_verse32"></a><b><sup>32 </sup></b>And the men are shepherds, because they became stock raisers; and their flocks and their herds and all they have they have brought here.’ <a id="chapter46_verse33"></a><b><sup>33 </sup></b>And what must occur is that when Phar′aoh will call <span class="smcap">YOU </span>and actually say, ‘What is <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>occupation?’ <a id="chapter46_verse34"></a><b><sup>34 </sup></b><span class="smcap">YOU </span>must say, ‘Your servants have continued to be stock raisers from our youth until now, both we and our forefathers,’ in order that <span class="smcap">YOU </span>may dwell in the land of Go′shen, because every herder of sheep is a detestable thing to Egypt.”</p>
