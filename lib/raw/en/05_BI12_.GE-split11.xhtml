<p class="w_biblebookname">Genesis</p><p class="sb"><a id="chapter11"></a><a id="chapter11_verse1"></a><span class="w_ch"><b>11 </b></span>Now all the earth continued to be of one language and of one set of words. <a id="chapter11_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>And it came about that in their journeying eastward they eventually discovered a valley plain in the land of Shi′nar, and they took up dwelling there. <a id="chapter11_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>And they began to say, each one to the other: “Come on! Let us make bricks and bake them with a burning process.” So brick served as stone for them, but bitumen served as mortar for them. <a id="chapter11_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>They now said: “Come on! Let us build ourselves a city and also a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves, for fear we may be scattered over all the surface of the earth.”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter11_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>And Jehovah proceeded to go down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men had built. <a id="chapter11_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>After that Jehovah said: “Look! They are one people and there is one language for them all, and this is what they start to do. Why, now there is nothing that they may have in mind to do that will be unattainable for them. <a id="chapter11_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>Come now! Let us go down and there confuse their language that they <a id="page19"></a>may not listen to one another’s language.” <a id="chapter11_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>Accordingly Jehovah scattered them from there over all the surface of the earth, and they gradually left off building the city. <a id="chapter11_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>That is why its name was called Ba′bel, because there Jehovah had confused the language of all the earth, and Jehovah had scattered them from there over all the surface of the earth.</p>
