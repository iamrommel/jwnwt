<p class="sb"><a id="chapter29_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>“This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said to all the exiled people, whom I have caused to go into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, <a id="chapter29_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>‘Build houses and inhabit them, and plant gardens and eat their fruitage. <a id="chapter29_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>Take wives and become father to sons and to daughters; and take wives for <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>own sons and give <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>own daughters to husbands, that they may give birth to sons and to daughters; and become many there, and do not become few. <a id="chapter29_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>Also, seek the peace of the city to which I have caused <span class="smcap">YOU </span>to go into exile, and pray in its behalf <a id="page1005"></a>to Jehovah, for in its peace there will prove to be peace for <span class="smcap">YOU </span>yourselves. <a id="chapter29_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>For this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said: “Let not <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>prophets who are in among <span class="smcap">YOU </span>and <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>practicers of divination deceive <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, and do not <span class="smcap">YOU </span>listen to their dreams that they are dreaming. <a id="chapter29_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>For ‘it is in falsehood that they are prophesying to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>in my name. I have not sent them,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.”’”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter29_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>“For this is what Jehovah has said, ‘In accord with the fulfilling of seventy years at Babylon I shall turn my attention to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people, and I will establish toward <span class="smcap">YOU </span>my good word in bringing <span class="smcap">YOU </span>back to this place.’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter29_verse11"></a><b><sup>11 </sup></b>“‘For I myself well know the thoughts that I am thinking toward <span class="smcap">YOU</span>,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘thoughts of peace, and not of calamity, to give <span class="smcap">YOU </span>a future and a hope. <a id="chapter29_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>And <span class="smcap">YOU </span>will certainly call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to <span class="smcap">YOU</span>.’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter29_verse13"></a><b><sup>13 </sup></b>“‘And <span class="smcap">YOU </span>will actually seek me and find me, for <span class="smcap">YOU </span>will search for me with all <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>heart. <a id="chapter29_verse14"></a><b><sup>14 </sup></b>And I will let myself be found by <span class="smcap">YOU</span>,’ is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘And I will gather <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>body of captives and collect <span class="smcap">YOU </span>together out of all the nations and out of all the places to which I have dispersed <span class="smcap">YOU</span>,’ is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘And I will bring <span class="smcap">YOU </span>back to the place from which I caused <span class="smcap">YOU </span>to go into exile.’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter29_verse15"></a><b><sup>15 </sup></b>“But <span class="smcap">YOU </span>have said, ‘Jehovah has raised up for us prophets in Babylon.’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter29_verse16"></a><b><sup>16 </sup></b>“For this is what Jehovah has said to the king sitting on the throne of David and to all the people dwelling in this city, <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>brothers that have not gone forth with <span class="smcap">YOU </span>into exile, <a id="chapter29_verse17"></a><b><sup>17 </sup></b>‘This is what Jehovah of armies has said: “Here I am sending against them the sword, the famine and the pestilence, and I will make them like the burst-open figs that cannot be eaten for badness.”’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter29_verse18"></a><b><sup>18 </sup></b>“‘And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine and with the pestilence, and I will give them for a quaking to all the kingdoms of the earth, for a curse and for an object of astonishment and for a whistling at and for a reproach among all the nations to which I shall certainly disperse them, <a id="chapter29_verse19"></a><b><sup>19 </sup></b>due to the fact that they have not listened to my words,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘that I have sent to them with my servants the prophets, getting up early and sending them.’</p>
<p class="sb">“‘But <span class="smcap">YOU </span>have not listened,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter29_verse20"></a><b><sup>20 </sup></b>“And as for <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, hear the word of Jehovah, all you exiled people, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon. <a id="chapter29_verse21"></a><b><sup>21 </sup></b>This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said concerning A′hab the son of Ko·lai′ah and to Zed·e·ki′ah the son of Ma·a·sei′ah, who are prophesying to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>falsehood in my own name, ‘Here I am giving them into the hand of Neb·u·chad·rez′zar the king of Babylon, and he must strike them down before <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>eyes. <a id="chapter29_verse22"></a><b><sup>22 </sup></b>And from them a malediction will certainly be taken on the part of the entire body of exiles of Judah that is in Babylon, saying: “May Jehovah make you like Zed·e·ki′ah and like A′hab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire!” <a id="chapter29_verse23"></a><b><sup>23 </sup></b>for the reason that they have carried on senselessness in Israel, and they keep committing adultery with the wives of their companions and keep speaking falsely in my own name the word that I did not command them.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="page1006"></a>“‘“And I am the One knowing and am a witness,” is the utterance of Jehovah.’”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter29_verse24"></a><b><sup>24 </sup></b>“And to She·mai′ah of Ne·hel′am you will say, <a id="chapter29_verse25"></a><b><sup>25 </sup></b>‘This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said: “For the reason that you yourself have sent in your name letters to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zeph·a·ni′ah the son of Ma·a·sei′ah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying, <a id="chapter29_verse26"></a><b><sup>26 </sup></b>‘Jehovah himself has made you priest instead of Je·hoi′a·da the priest, in order to become the grand overseer of the house of Jehovah toward any man maddened and behaving like a prophet, and you must put him into the stocks and into the pillory; <a id="chapter29_verse27"></a><b><sup>27 </sup></b>now, then, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of An′a·thoth, who is behaving as a prophet to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people? <a id="chapter29_verse28"></a><b><sup>28 </sup></b>For that is why he has sent to us at Babylon, saying: “It is long drawn out! Build houses and inhabit them, and plant gardens and eat their fruitage,—”’”’”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter29_verse29"></a><b><sup>29 </sup></b>And Zeph·a·ni′ah the priest proceeded to read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter29_verse30"></a><b><sup>30 </sup></b>Then the word of Jehovah occurred to Jeremiah, saying: <a id="chapter29_verse31"></a><b><sup>31 </sup></b>“Send to all the exiled people, saying, ‘This is what Jehovah has said concerning She·mai′ah of Ne·hel′am: “For the reason that She·mai′ah has prophesied to <span class="smcap">YOU </span>people, but I myself did not send him, and he tried to make <span class="smcap">YOU </span>trust in falsehood, <a id="chapter29_verse32"></a><b><sup>32 </sup></b>therefore this is what Jehovah has said, ‘Here I am turning my attention upon She·mai′ah of Ne·hel′am and upon his offspring.’</p>
<p class="sb">“‘“‘He will not come to have a man dwelling in the midst of this people; and he will not look upon the good that I am doing for my people,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘for he has spoken outright revolt against Jehovah.’”’”</p>
