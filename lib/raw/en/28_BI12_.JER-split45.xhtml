<p class="sb"><a id="chapter45_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>“This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said concerning you, O Bar′uch, <a id="chapter45_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>‘You have said: “Woe, now, to me, for Jehovah has added grief to my pain! I have grown weary because of my sighing, and no resting-place have I found.”’</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter45_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>“This is what you should say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Look! What I have built up I am tearing down, and what I have planted I am uprooting, even all the land itself. <a id="chapter45_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>But as for you, you keep seeking great things for yourself. Do not keep on seeking.”’</p>
<p class="sb">“‘For here I am bringing in a calamity upon all flesh,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and I will give you your soul as a spoil in all the places to which you may go.’”</p>
