<p class="sb"><a id="chapter3_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>And I proceeded to purchase her for myself for fifteen silver pieces and a ho′mer measure of barley and a half-ho′mer of barley. <a id="chapter3_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>Then I said to her: “For many days you will dwell as mine. You must not commit fornication, and you must not come to belong to another man; and I also will be for you.”</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter3_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>It is because for many days the sons of Israel will dwell without a king and without a prince and without a sacrifice and without a pillar and without an eph′od and teraphim. <a id="chapter3_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>Afterwards the sons of Israel will come back and certainly look for Jehovah their God, and for David their king; and they will certainly come quivering to Jehovah and to his goodness in the final part of the days.</p>
