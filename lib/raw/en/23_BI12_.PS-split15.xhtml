<p class="sz">Who will reside in your holy mountain?</p>
<p class="sl"><a id="chapter15_verse2"></a> <b><sup>2 </sup></b>He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness</p>
<p class="sz">And speaking the truth in his heart.</p>
<p class="sl"><a id="chapter15_verse3"></a> <b><sup>3 </sup></b>He has not slandered with his tongue.</p>
<p class="sz">To his companion he has done nothing bad,</p>
<p class="sz">And no reproach has he taken up against his intimate acquaintance.</p>
<p class="sl"><a id="chapter15_verse4"></a> <b><sup>4 </sup></b>In his eyes anyone contemptible is certainly rejected,</p>
<p class="sz">But those fearing Jehovah he honors.</p>
<p class="sz">He has sworn to what is bad for himself, and yet he does not alter.</p>
<p class="sl"><a id="chapter15_verse5"></a> <b><sup>5 </sup></b>His money he has not given out on interest,</p>
<p class="sz">And a bribe against the innocent one he has not taken.</p>
<p class="sz">He that is doing these things will never be made to totter.</p>
