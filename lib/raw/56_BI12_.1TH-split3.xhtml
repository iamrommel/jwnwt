<p class="w_biblebookname">1 Thessalonians</p><p class="sb"><a id="chapter3"></a><a id="chapter3_verse1"></a><span class="w_ch"><b>3 </b></span>Hence, when we could bear it no longer, we saw good to be left alone in Athens; <a id="chapter3_verse2"></a><b><sup>2 </sup></b>and we sent Timothy, our brother and Godâ€™s minister in the good news about the Christ, in order to make <span class="smcap">YOU </span>firm and comfort <span class="smcap">YOU </span>in behalf of <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>faith, <a id="chapter3_verse3"></a><b><sup>3 </sup></b>that no one might be swayed by these tribulations. For <span class="smcap">YOU </span>yourselves know we are appointed to this very thing. <a id="chapter3_verse4"></a><b><sup>4 </sup></b>In fact, too, when we were with <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, we used to tell <span class="smcap">YOU </span>beforehand that we were destined to suffer tribulation, just as it has also happened and as <span class="smcap">YOU </span>know. <a id="chapter3_verse5"></a><b><sup>5 </sup></b>That is why, indeed, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to know of <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>faithfulness, as perhaps in some way the Tempter might have tempted <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, and our labor might have turned out to be in vain.</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter3_verse6"></a><b><sup>6 </sup></b>But Timothy has just now come to us from <span class="smcap">YOU </span>and given us the good news about <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>faithfulness and love, and that <span class="smcap">YOU </span>continue having good remembrance of us always, yearning to see us in the same way, indeed, as we also do <span class="smcap">YOU</span>. <a id="chapter3_verse7"></a><b><sup>7 </sup></b>That is why, brothers, we have been comforted over <span class="smcap">YOU </span>in all our necessity and tribulation through the faithfulness <span class="smcap">YOU </span>show, <a id="chapter3_verse8"></a><b><sup>8 </sup></b>because now we live if <span class="smcap">YOU </span>stand firm in the Lord. <a id="chapter3_verse9"></a><b><sup>9 </sup></b>For what thanksgiving can we render to God concerning <span class="smcap">YOU </span>in return for all the joy with which we are rejoicing on <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>account before our God, <a id="chapter3_verse10"></a><b><sup>10 </sup></b>while night and day we make more than extraordinary supplications to see <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>faces and to make good the things that are lacking about <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>faith?</p>
<p class="sb"><a id="chapter3_verse11"></a><b><sup>11 </sup></b>Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way prosperously to <span class="smcap">YOU</span>. <a id="chapter3_verse12"></a><b><sup>12 </sup></b>Moreover, may the Lord cause <span class="smcap">YOU </span>to increase, yes, make <span class="smcap">YOU </span>abound, in love to one another and to all, even as we also do to <span class="smcap">YOU</span>; <a id="chapter3_verse13"></a><b><sup>13 </sup></b>to the end that he may make <span class="smcap">YOUR </span>hearts firm, unblamable in holiness before our God and Father at the presence of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones.</p>
